      <p>Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by <a
          href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a>. Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the
        following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, <a href="/404">404</a>, <a href="/atom.xml">RSS feed</a>,
          posts, and <a href="/about">example page</a>)</li>
        <li>Mobile friendly design and development</li>
        <li>Easily scalable text and component sizing with <code>rem</code> units in the CSS</li>
        <li>Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements</li>
        <li>Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post</li>
        <li>Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Hyde features</h3>

      <p>In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
        </li>
        <li>Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and <a
            href="https://github.com/poole/hyde#reverse-layout">reverse</a> (right sidebar), available via
          <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> classes
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes">Eight optional color schemes</a>, available via
          <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> classes
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Browser support</h3>

      <p>Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile
        and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.</p>

      <h3>Download</h3>

      <p>Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub
          repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.</p>

      <p>Thanks!</p> -->
